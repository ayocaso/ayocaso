## Hey! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Caden, and I'm from the United States. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ <br />
I like to program in my spare time, often in Python or Javascript, though I am fluent in neither.

### Current Projects:
- None! <br />
I work on whatever, whenever! There's nothing I'm currently committed to, but I would like to start working on some projects soon (if I ever stop procrastinating).  
  
  
  
### Interests:
- [Rec Room](https://rec.net/user/Casorama): <br />
I am an avid Rec Room player! I enjoy working with the in-game circuits system, which has paved the way for my programming passion.

- General Gaming & VR: <br />
As would be assumed by my interest in Rec Room, I enjoy VR and screen gaming, to an extent.
